# TravelTide Customer Segmentation

## Introduction
TravelTide's initiative to segment customers combines demographic data and booking behaviors to enhance the user experience and drive revenue.
Our analysis uses K-means clustering to identify segments such as '1 Night Free Hotel and Flight' enthusiasts and 'No Cancellation Fee' seekers.

## Segmentation Highlights
- **Perk Preferences**: Segmented by popular perks with conditions based on booking activities and spending.
- **Demographics**: Categorized into groups like 'Teenage Single Males' and 'Young Adult Family Females'.
- **Clustering Results**: Visual clustering with `n_components=3` and `n_clusters=5` reveals distinct behavioral patterns.
